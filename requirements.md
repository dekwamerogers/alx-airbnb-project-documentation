# Backend Feature Requirements

This document details the technical and functional requirements for three key backend features of the system: **User Authentication**, **Property Management**, and **Booking System**.

## 1. User Authentication

### Functional Requirements

* Users must be able to register with their email, username, and password.
* Users must be able to log in with valid credentials.
* Passwords must be securely hashed and never stored in plain text.
* Users should receive a JWT token upon successful login for session management.

### API Endpoints

* **POST /api/auth/register**

  * **Input**: `{ username, email, password }`
  * **Output**: `{ userId, username, email, message }`
* **POST /api/auth/login**

  * **Input**: `{ email, password }`
  * **Output**: `{ token, userId, username }`
* **POST /api/auth/logout**

  * **Input**: `{ token }`
  * **Output**: `{ message }`

### Validation Rules

* Email must be unique and properly formatted.
* Password must have a minimum of 8 characters, including one uppercase, one lowercase, and one number.
* Username must be unique and at least 3 characters long.

### Performance Criteria

* Authentication response time should not exceed **300ms** under normal load.
* Token expiration: 24 hours.

## 2. Property Management

### Functional Requirements

* Hosts must be able to add, update, and delete property listings.
* Properties should have attributes such as title, description, price, location, and availability.
* Guests should be able to view all available properties.

### API Endpoints

* **POST /api/properties** (Host only)

  * **Input**: `{ title, description, price, location, availability }`
  * **Output**: `{ propertyId, message }`
* **GET /api/properties**

  * **Output**: `[{ propertyId, title, description, price, location, availability }]`
* **PUT /api/properties/{id}** (Host only)

  * **Input**: `{ title?, description?, price?, location?, availability? }`
  * **Output**: `{ propertyId, message }`
* **DELETE /api/properties/{id}** (Host only)

  * **Output**: `{ message }`

### Validation Rules

* Title must be at least 5 characters.
* Price must be a positive numeric value.
* Location must be a valid string with minimum 3 characters.

### Performance Criteria

* Fetching properties should support pagination with default limit = 10.
* Queries must be indexed on `location` and `price` for fast searching.

## 3. Booking System

### Functional Requirements

* Guests must be able to create bookings for available properties.
* Hosts must be able to view booking requests.
* Booking must prevent overlapping dates for the same property.

### API Endpoints

* **POST /api/bookings**

  * **Input**: `{ userId, propertyId, startDate, endDate }`
  * **Output**: `{ bookingId, message }`
* **GET /api/bookings/{userId}**

  * **Output**: `[{ bookingId, propertyId, startDate, endDate, status }]`
* **PUT /api/bookings/{id}/cancel**

  * **Output**: `{ bookingId, status: "cancelled" }`

### Validation Rules

* Start date must be before end date.
* Property must exist and be available during the requested time.
* User must not exceed maximum concurrent bookings (limit: 5).

### Performance Criteria

* Booking conflict check should run in **<200ms**.
* System should handle **500 concurrent booking requests** without failure.

## Conclusion

These backend requirements ensure secure authentication, efficient property management, and reliable booking processes. They provide the foundation for a scalable and user-friendly system.
